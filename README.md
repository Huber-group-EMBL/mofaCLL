This package contains the R code implementing the computational analysis steps, in the form of Rmarkdown documents, that enable readers to reproduce all major figures and results reported in manuscript "Multi-omics reveals clinically relevant proliferative drive associated with mTOR-MYC-OXPHOS activity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia" by Lu and Cannizzaro et al.. In addition, the CLLAIestimate function in the R package can be used to compute CLL-PD from compatible gene expression data provided by users. Instructions can be found in the vignette of the package.
