Version: 0.0.9
Author: Junyan Lu
Maintainer: Junyan Lu <junyan.lu@embl.de>
Description: This package includes the data and codes that can be used to reproduce the analysis results included in the paper "Multi-omics data integration identifies mTOR-MYC-OXPHOS as a driver of aggressive chronic lymphocytic leukemia" by Lu et al. It also provide a function, CLLAIestimate, to compute CLL-AI values based on gene expression profiling data.
